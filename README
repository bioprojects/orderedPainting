#---------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Setting of your grid engine
#---------------------------------------------------------

orderedPainting is implemented based on a grid engine
(UGE/SGE or LSF) which can execute array jobs.

The default setting is UGE/SGE.  If you would like to use 
LSF instead, please edit "lib/env_func.bashrc" as below

  #QUEUE_TYPE="SGE"                        # comment out
  #QSUB_COMMON="qsub -cwd "                # comment out
  #MAX_MEMORY="-l s_vmem=8G -l mem_req=8"  # comment out
  
  QUEUE_TYPE="LSF"          # comment in instead
  QSUB_COMMON="bsub "       # comment in instead
  MAX_MEMORY="-M 8000000"   # comment in instead



#---------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Setup
#---------------------------------------------------------

Please execute "setup.sh" as follows.
It will set programs used in orderedPainting.sh
(e.g., download and compile ChromoPainter and GNU sort).

  $ /bin/bash setup.sh

Compilation of one of the programs (GNU sort) requires a few minutes.
Please wait during that time.



#---------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Basic usage
#---------------------------------------------------------

The following is the most basic example which uses files in the "example1" directory.

  $ qsub -cwd -o example1.log -e example1.log <<< "/bin/bash ./orderedPainting.sh  -g example1/simulatedData_N100.hap  -l example1/strainName_N100.txt"
  
  (If you use LSF, please use "bsub" instead of "qsub -cwd")

The format of the ".hap" file is the same as ChromoPainter.

The ".list" is a 1-column file which indicates name of each strain in the ".hap" file.



#---------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Output
#---------------------------------------------------------

Please check the log file you specified above.

  $ tail example1.log

If the program finished running normally, the following message 
will be written in the log file

  Done. Please look at output files in simulatedData_N100_orderedS1_rnd_1_10_dirs_results

Please look at the output files there. 

  $ ls simulatedData_N100_orderedS1_rnd_1_10_dirs_results/

The following files and directories will be seen.

  |
  |-- results_siteStats.txt.gz
  |-- results_siteStats_along_seq.png
  |-- results_siteStats_hist.png
  |-- results_siteStats_summary.pos.txt
  |
  |-- (results_siteStats_missingCnt.png
       , which will be produced only if imputed data are analyzed)


If "-x" was specified, the following files and directories are also created.

  |
  |-- sum_site_minus_average.summary.range.txt
  |-- sum_site_minus_average.summary.txt.gz
  |
  |-- visualize_bottom/
  |-- visualize_bottom.list
  |-- visualize_middle/
  |-- visualize_middle.list
  |-- visualize_top/
  |-- visualize_top.list



"results_siteStats.txt.gz" contains values of the distance statistic and bootstrap support of each site.

"results_siteStats_along_seq.png" shows intensity of recombination (distribution of the distance statistic) 
along the genome.  Two recombination hot regions should be seen.

"results_siteStats_hist.png" shows a histogram of the distance statistic.

"results_siteStats_summary.pos.txt" contains information of representative sites picked up from
the top/middle/bottom of the distribution.



Other log files are produced temporarily in a current directory, and then moved 
to the "log" directory.  If the output files are successfully obtained, 
there is no need to check these additional log files.



#---------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Usage for imputed data
#---------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to use imputed data, please prepare a file which indicates

  position[tab]name of missing strain at the position

For example,

  64	strain1
  64	strain5
  100	strain1

indicates strain1 and strain5 are missing at position 64, and 
strain 1 is missing at position 100.

Please specify the file by "-m" option in orderedPainting.sh

The file is used to calculate site-by-site and average copying probability matrices 
by masking columns and rows of missing individuals at a site.



#---------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Re-execution
#---------------------------------------------------------

If orderedPainting stopped during its computation, for example
by an occasional problem of your grid engine (such as incomplete
execution of a part of array jobs), please re-execute the command 
as previously after fixing the problem.

It should restart computation at an appropriate step and 
proceed to the end.  If there are incomplete temporary files
in output directories, please remove them before re-execution.



#---------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Disk and memory usage
#---------------------------------------------------------

The disk usage of orderedPainting depends on the number of 
SNPs and *squared* number of individuals, and it can produce 
a large amount of temporary data from a large input dataset.

For example, 200 genomes with 100,000 SNPs require about 
20GB per ordering (forward or reverse).

The temporary disk space is required to store and format
uncompressed output files of ChromoPainter without using
a large memory.  The files are compressed during post-processing.

The number of orderings processed simultaneously in the step
can be specified by "-n" option (default is 20).

Depending on limitation of disk in your environment,
please use the "-n" option to specify a smaller number,
although it takes longer time to process all of the orderings.


Meanwhile, the memory usage of orderedPainting depends on 
only the number of SNPs but not on that of individuals.

For example, about 360,000 SNPs require about 5.5GB RAM,
which is used to combine results of all orderings and 
examine each SNP in terms of intensity of recombination
(the distance statistic and bootstrap support).

The upper limit of memory usage for your grid engine can 
be speficied by "MAX_MEMORY" in "lib/env_func.bashrc" above.
